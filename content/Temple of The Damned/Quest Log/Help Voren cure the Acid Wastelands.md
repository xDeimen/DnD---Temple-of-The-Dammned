- [[Voren the Alchemist]] told you that they are probably the source of this world's ruin. He tells you that you can either revert these generators so that they produce clear air, or destroy them in order to stop the Corruption to spread.
- After "Infiltrating" in the corrupted camp you find out from [[content/Temple of The Damned/Characters/Xenthor|Xenthor]] that there were originally 6 generators, 2 were destroyed in the fire at the Corrupted Gate and 1 was destroyed by [[The Nomads]] . 3 Remain.
